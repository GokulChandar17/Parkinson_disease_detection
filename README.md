In this code:

- I've imported the required libraries. [Random Forest, Scikit-learn]
- Load the dataset.
- Split the data into features (X) and target variable (Y).
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Standardize the features using StandardScaler.
- Initialize and train the Random Forest Classifier.
- Make predictions on both training and testing data.
- Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
- Finally, we make a sample prediction using the trained model.
