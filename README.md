The existing one was with SVM. 

Tried to apply random forest

In Random forest code:

- I've imported the required libraries. [Random Forest, Scikit-learn]
- Load the dataset.
- Splited the data into features (X) and target variable (Y).
- Splited the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Standardized the features using StandardScaler.
- Initialized and train the Random Forest Classifier.
- Made predictions on both training and testing data.
- Evaluated the model's performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
- Finally, made a sample prediction using the trained model.

In TensorFlow:

- Imported the required libraries.
- Load the dataset.
- Splited the data into features (X) and target variable (Y).
- Splited the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Standardized the features using StandardScaler.
- Built a neural network model using TensorFlow's Sequential API.
- Compiled the model with binary cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer.
- Trained the model on the training data.
- Evaluate the model's performance on both training and testing data.
- Make predictions on the testing data and print the confusion matrix and classification report.
- Finally, made a sample prediction using the trained model.
